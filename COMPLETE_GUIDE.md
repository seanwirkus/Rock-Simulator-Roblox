## TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS

### Physics Implementation
```lua
-- Directional jumping with rolling
local jumpVelocity = Vector3.new(jumpDir.X * 20, 18, jumpDir.Z * 20)
-- BodyVelocity applies velocity
-- BodyGyro applies rotation
```

### Camera System
```lua
-- Scriptable camera with orbit controls
-- Spherical coordinates for smooth panning
-- Mouse delta tracking for precision
```

### Evolution System
```lua
-- Stage progression based on elapsed time
-- Visual effects applied at each stage
-- UI updates automatically
```
