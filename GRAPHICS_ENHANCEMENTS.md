# Graphics Enhancement Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **Rock Size** ✓
- Increased by 50% using `* 1.5` scaling
- All parts of the rock model scale proportionally
- Makes the rock more imposing and visible

### 2. **Removed Floating Circles** ✓
- Deleted the 20 decorative floating rocks that were cluttering the sky
- Cleaner, less confusing visual experience
- No more unexplained spheres

### 3. **Terrain Graphics** ✓
- Baseplate now uses `Material.Ground` for more realistic appearance
- Beautiful grass green color (RGB: 34, 139, 34)
- Variety of terrain materials:
  - Grass hills and valleys
  - Water lake/pond with reflections
  - Caves for exploration
  - Stone and rock formations

### 4. **Lighting System** ✓
- **Ambient Lighting**: Bright and welcoming (RGB: 200, 200, 200 server, 220, 220, 220 client)
- **Brightness**: Boosted to 2.5 for visibility
- **Fog**: 
  - Fog End: 500 studs (distant visibility)
  - Fog Start: 0 (no near clipping)
  - Fog Color: Sky blue (RGB: 200, 220, 255)
- **Time of Day**: 2:30 PM (optimal lighting angle)

### 5. **Sun/Point Light** ✓
- Added a glowing sun object at coordinates (100, 100, 100)
- Neon material with golden yellow color (RGB: 255, 255, 150)
- Point light with:
  - Brightness: 3
  - Range: 200 studs
  - Warm white color (RGB: 255, 255, 200)
- Creates dramatic shadows and warm atmosphere

### 6. **Camera Settings** ✓
- Field of View: 80° (from default 70°)
- Wider cinematic view
- Better sense of scale
- Scriptable camera for full control
- Smooth orbiting with right-mouse drag

### 7. **Visual Polish** ✓
- All terrain surfaces have proper materials for depth
- Neon sun creates atmospheric glow
- Ground material adds texture
- Water reflects light naturally
- Fog creates atmospheric perspective

## Result

The world now looks:
- **More beautiful** - Professional lighting and materials
- **More spacious** - Wider FOV and better visibility
- **More peaceful** - Warm, welcoming color palette
- **More immersive** - Larger rock, proper shadows and lighting
- **Less cluttered** - No confusing floating objects

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal**: All changes use built-in Roblox rendering
- One additional PointLight (negligible performance cost)
- Lighting adjustments (no additional cost)
- Camera FOV change (no cost)
- Scaling uses standard Roblox mesh scaling (efficient)

## Next Graphics Enhancements

Consider adding:
1. **Particle effects** - Dust clouds when rock lands, water splashes
2. **Post-processing** - Bloom for sun glow
3. **Shader effects** - Better water reflections, cloud movement
4. **Object glow** - Evolution milestone visual effects
5. **Shadow mapping** - More dramatic terrain shadows
6. **Ambient occlusion** - Better depth perception
